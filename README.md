# Overview

`pathfindR.data` is the data package for [`pathfindR`](https://github.com/egeulgen/pathfindR),
containing data needed to use pathfindR, including protein-protein interaction 
network data, gene sets-related data and example input/output data.

# pathfindR

`pathfindR` is a tool for enrichment analysis via active subnetworks.
The package also offers functionalities to cluster the enriched terms
and identify representative terms in each cluster, to score the enriched
terms per sample and to visualize analysis results.

The functionalities of pathfindR is described in detail in *Ulgen E,
Ozisik O, Sezerman OU. 2019. pathfindR: An R Package for Comprehensive
Identification of Enriched Pathways in Omics Data Through Active
Subnetworks. Front. Genet. <https://doi.org/10.3389/fgene.2019.00858>*

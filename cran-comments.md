  This is the first submission for pathfindR.data. This is a data-only package,
  containing data needed to use the CRAN package package pathfindR. As 
  suggested, we created this separate data-only package, which will be rarely 
  updated, to reduce the size of the main package.

## Downstream dependencies
  There are currently no downstream dependencies for this package.
